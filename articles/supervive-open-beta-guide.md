Notable mentions:

- **Elluna** is the easiest hunter to pick up and play due to her intuitive abilities and high survivability, making her
  an incredible pick for beginners.
- We believe that **Hudson** and **Ghost** are also easier for beginners due to their consistency, akin to hitscan
  characters in other games.
- We think that **Jin** is much more skill reliant and is harder to play effectively especially for beginners due to his
  playstyle of being a melee assassin, and having lower survivability.

## For Tryhards

This tier list focuses on:

- Current meta picks
- High-skill ceiling hunters
- Team fight impact

Notable mentions:

- **Void** is probably the most valuable hunter in this category due to his team fighting presence with abilities such
  as "Swap" and "Unstable Anomaly".
- We decided to bump **Brall** to S due to his skill-ceiling.
- **Elluna** is probably one of the weaker picks in this category due to other hunters being able to outperform her in
  the current meta.
- Despite **Jin** and **Shiv** being high-skill hunters, we think that the other hunters simply outperform them in the
  current meta.
