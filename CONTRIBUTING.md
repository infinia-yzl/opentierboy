### Current Image Sets

We currently have the following image sets that you can contribute to:

To contribute to these existing image sets, please follow the general contribution guidelines above and make sure to
adhere to any specific guidelines provided in each image set's repository.

### Getting Started with the Image Set Template

1. Visit the [image-set template repository](https://github.com/yourusername/image-set-template).
2. Click on "Use this template" to create a new repository based on the template.
3. Clone your new repository locally.

### Setting Up Your Image Set

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Update the `package.json` file:
    - Change the `name` field to a unique name for your image set
    - Update the `description`, `keywords`, and `author` fields

3. Add your images:
    - Place your images in the `public/images/` directory

4. Process your images:
   ```
   npm run process-images
   ```
   This will run an interactive CLI where you can compress and tag your images.

5. Publish your package:
   ```
   npm run publish-package
   ```

For more detailed instructions on using the image-set template, please refer to its README file.

### Submitting Your Image Set

Once you've published your image set package:

1. Open a pull request to the main OpenTierBoy repository.
2. In your pull request, include:
    - The name of your published npm package
    - A brief description of the image set
    - Any relevant tags or categories for the images

Our team will review your submission and integrate it into the project if it meets our guidelines.
